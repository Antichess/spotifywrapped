# Spotify Wrapped
Every year when I recieve my Spotify Wrapped, I feel like there's some injustice between some of the data. For example, there are two artists I listened to a lot in 2020. Both artists had around 3000 streams. The key difference was that one of the artists had songs that averaged 10-12 minutes, while the other artist was averaging around 3-4 minutes per song. I thought of this to be dumb, and wanted a way to find out the actual time-based weighting of each artist.

This tool will use a python script to scrape the song history of Spotify data. You can get this via [Spotify's Privacy Settings](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/), but it will require a few days to process and get it emailed to you.
